     <p class="quoteblock alignba">Autobiography is the
       most fascinating thing you can do
       because you get to touch the human
       condition. And in the end, what else
       is there? To me, it's the ultimate
       affirmation of life, and a miracle of
       this transient, extremely fragile
       organism. To celebrate that, I think,
       is a noble thing to do."</p>

       <p class="quoteblock alignbb">"My attitude
     towards drawing is not necessarily
     about drawing. It's about making the
     best kind of image I can make, it's
     about talking as clearly as I can."</p>

    <div class="quotessection">
     <p class="quoteblock alignba">"The figure
   is still the only thing I have faith in
   in terms of how much emotion it's
   charged with and how much subject matter
   is there."</p>

<div class="quotessection">
 <p class="quoteblock alignbb">"My life is
   really a history of observing forms and
   taking in imagery. I don't mean in a
   photographic way, I mean in a way of
   feeling them structurally."</p>

<div class="quotessection">
 <p class="quoteblock alignba">"For me,
   drawing is everything, because it informs
   everything. It even informs my poetry.
   It's the way I begin everything."</p>
